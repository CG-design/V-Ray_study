Welcome to V-Ray for 3ds Max’s official Courseware site. The goal of this courseware is to improve the level of knowledge of V-Ray among its users.

#### [Downloading the scenes and assets](https://www.chaosgroup.com/education/vray-3ds-max-courseware/assets) for this courseware requires a free [Chaos Group account](https://accounts.chaosgroup.com/service_login?return_to=https://www.chaosgroup.com/).

**Courseware Highlights**
-------------------------

* * *

*   **Modular:** All the essential V-Ray knowledge is divided into modules to easily fit different types of curriculum.
*   **Easy to learn and use:** Users have all materials in a ready to teach, learn and use format.
*   **Quality:** Our curriculum has been developed with professionals and educators around the world to ensure we’re up to date with cutting edge trends in visualization.
*   **All training needs:** Each lesson includes lectures, lesson plans, handouts, demonstration tutorials, scenes, assets, and practice assignments.
*   **Designed for adult learners:** Based on the proven concept of learning cycles, which splits each lesson into lecture, demonstration and activity.
*   **Creative control:** We’ve done all the hard work of creating a curriculum, so educators and users can focus on teaching, learning and artistry.
*   **The industry standard:** Top studios around the world rely on V-Ray every day to visualize world-class products, buildings and visual effects. Students will learn industry standard skills to kick-start their careers.

**Content Overview**

* * *

The courseware is based on the concept of learning cycles, a proven method for teaching adults. This concept splits each topic into three distinct cycles:

1.  Lecture – This introduces the theory of the topic. This is the time to show imagery, discuss theories, make the connection between CG and the real world, and explain what settings do.
2.  Demonstration – Topics discussed in the lecture are put into action by the educator. It is important that students do not try to copy what is being shown so they can pay full attention to the demonstration and explanations.
3.  Activity – Students gain vital hands-on experience be reproducing what they have seen, and can do their own experiments. This cycle gives the students the chance to try out settings, solve problems, and ask questions.

The courseware provides you with materials for each of the three cycles for every Topic:

1.  Lecture – This includes a PowerPoint presentation, and a sample lesson plan to help your preparations.
2.  Demonstration and Activity – We provide you with 3ds Max scenes, and Lesson guides. Lesson guides include a sample exercise sequence for the demonstration, and they can be distributed to students. The PowerPoint presentations and Lesson guides can be downloaded separately from the page for each lesson as well as in the [Download](https://docs.chaosgroup.com/display/TR/Download+Assets+and+Scenes) section of this courseware.

Scenes and assets are packed into a project file. These must be downloaded together to ensure that all textures and other assets will load correctly.
